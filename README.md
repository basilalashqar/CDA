Overview

Our data analysis project focused on extracting insights from e-commerce transaction data. Through rigorous preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model selection, we aimed to provide valuable insights and predictions for future policies and decisions.


Data Preprocessing

Cleaned and handled missing values and outliers in the dataset.
Removed irrelevant columns and encoded categorical variables.
Ensured data quality and consistency for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Conducted univariate, bivariate, and advanced graphical analyses to explore data relationships.
Identified trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset.

Model Selection and Evaluation

Selected classification methods including Decision Tree and Naive Bayes for model building.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

Libraries Used

Pandas: Data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy: Numerical computing and array manipulation.

Matplotlib: Data visualization and plotting.

Seaborn: Enhanced data visualization.

scikit-learn: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.

Dataset:

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.com and consists of e-commerce transaction data from an online American store.
